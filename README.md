This is one of the _Real-Time Twitter Monitoring, Analysis and Reporting of Bangkok’s Pedestrian Sidewalk Issues for Traffy Fondue System_ modules. We aim to assist the Traffy Fondue platform’s process in monitoring Bangkok’s citizen pedestrian sidewalk issues on Twitter in real-time on an hourly basis, NLP text-relevant classification, visualizing the issues and their analytics on a web-based Power BI dashboard, and automating the integration of the issues to the input of Traffy Fondue.
